# BioNet-Mining (under construction!)
The repository will contain the scripts for a workflow that identifies frequent structural patterns in biochemical reaction networks encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language. 
The workflow utilises the subgraph mining algorithm gSpan to detect frequent network patterns.
Once patterns are identified, the textual pattern description can automatically be converted into a graphical representation. 
Furthermore, information about the distribution of patterns among the selected set of models can be retrieved.
The workflow can be applied to a custom set of models or to models already existing in the graph database MASYMOS.
